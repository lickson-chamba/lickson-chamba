Hi, i'm Lickson

Computer science student at the University Of South Africa who likes building practical projects while learning the fundamentals. I enjoy Python, C++, backend basics, and small cybersecurity tools.

What I’m into right now:

   Python scripts for security (scanners, hash tools)
    
   Backend development and web projects
    
   Understanding computer systems and algorithms
    
   Improving my logic through CS coursework

Current projects:

   A dynamic blog website for the George Maluleka Foundation
    
   Practice tools in Python to sharpen my skills

   A bit about me:

   Big One Piece fan
    
Anime keeps me sane during study sessions
    
  I speed-solve Rubik’s cubes when I need a break

Always learning, always building. Feel free to check out my work or drop feedback.
