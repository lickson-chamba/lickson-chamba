YOOOOOO
I'm a computer science student who spends most of my time building things that help me learn. I like working with Python and C++, exploring how systems work under the hood, and applying what I’m learning to real projects.

Right now I’m focused on:

Strengthening my core CS fundamentals

Getting comfortable with backend development

Working on cybersecurity-related Python tools

Building a dynamic, professional blog for the George Maluleka Foundation

🔧 Tech I Use

  Languages: Python, C++, JavaScript
  
  Tools & Concepts: Algorithms, data structures, OOP, backend basics, cybersecurity fundamentals
  
  Interests: AI for security, automation scripts, small utilities, system concepts

📚 What I’m Learning

  Deeper Python (loops, data structures, file handling, modules)
  
  Web development and backend logic
  
  Computer Systems (architecture, memory, low-level concepts)
  
  Linear Algebra and theoretical CS
  
  Practical cybersecurity (CTFs, scanners, hash tools)

🧪 Projects I'm Building

  Python security tools (port scanners, hash crackers, log analyzers)
  
  GMF Blog: A fully dynamic site with animations and a clean layout
  
  Small practice scripts to sharpen fundamentals
  
  Coursework implementations for COS, INF, and MAT modules

🎯 Goals

  Build a portfolio of real, working projects
  
  Become confident in backend development
  
  Create more security-oriented tools using Python
  
  Keep improving through consistent project work

📬 Always Learning
