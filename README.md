Hi, i'm Lickson

Computer science student at the University Of South Africa who likes building practical projects while learning the fundamentals. I enjoy Python, C++, backend basics, and small cybersecurity tools.

What I’m into right now:

    Python scripts for security (scanners, hash tools)
    
    Backend development and web projects
    
    Understanding computer systems and algorithms
    
    Improving my logic through CS coursework

Current projects:

    A dynamic blog website for the George Maluleka Foundation
    
    Practice tools in Python to sharpen my skills

A bit about me:

    Big One Piece fan
    
    Anime keeps me sane during study sessions
    
    I speed-solve Rubik’s cubes when I need a break

Always learning, always building. Feel free to check out my work or drop feedback.
